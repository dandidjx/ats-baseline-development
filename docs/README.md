# Docs Overview

This folder is the documentation baseline for the ATS/HRIS project.  
Treat it as a rulebook and product specification that AI agents and contributors must consult before implementation work.

## Subfolders
- `Requirements HRIS and ATS/`: functional entities, architecture, and UI requirements.
- `Tech Principles/`: architecture and technical standards used to guide implementation choices.
- `Reusable Components/`: shared UI/component guidance and reusable patterns.
- `Mockup/`: mockup references and notes that support app implementation.

## Usage Rules
- Start with this file, then read the relevant subfolder `README.md`.
- Keep files in the existing naming style and sequence (for example `01-...`, `02-...`).
- If a folder contains `.md` files, its `README.md` should describe them.
- Archived or scratch material belongs in `_archived/` paths (gitignored).
