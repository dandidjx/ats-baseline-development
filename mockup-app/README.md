# Mockup App

React + Vite prototype for the ATS board mockup derived from:
- `docs/Mockup/Main Page/main_page.html`
- `docs/Mockup/Main Page/main_page.png`

## Commands
- `npm install` installs dependencies.
- `npm run dev` starts the local development server.
- `npm run build` creates a production build in `dist/`.
- `npm run preview` serves the production build locally.

## Scope (v1)
- Desktop-first mockup parity for the Job Openings board.
- UI-only interactions with local typed mock data:
  - search
  - lifecycle selection
  - organization filter
  - sort options
  - board/list toggle
- No API integration or persistence in this phase.
